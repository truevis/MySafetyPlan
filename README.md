MySafetyPlan
============

Provides continuity of care and follow-up care information and links for a person at risk for suicide who may have been discharged from an inpatient unit or emergency department.

Caveats: The code is in prototype form as a Web app. The Settings screen is not yet functional, and is intended to link to a method of entering the data for the user. The app's content is intended to be customized for each user in conjunction with the user's treatment provider. The app's content should be available on- or off-line.

The idea for this App was from a paper entitled "Safety Plan Treatment Manual to Reduce Suicide Risk: Veteran Version" which suggests having a counselor work with the person at risk to collect important help information and write it down on a form.
